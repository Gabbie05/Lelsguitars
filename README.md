# lelsguitars
Welcome, and thank you for visiting. This page is dedicated to our daughter Eleni, “Lels,” who passed away in August 2024 at just 21, after a brave fight with bone cancer.
 Her strength, humour, and positivity continue to inspire us every day. The name and logo honour her: an elephant, her favourite animal, drawn from a tattoo she designed, with its legs spelling her name in ancient runes.

I have been building guitars for years, learning through trial, error, and passion. Each instrument is handmade here in Abu Dhabi — from selecting the wood to shaping, sanding, and polishing. The necks are built to my specifications, as they require extreme precision. No CNC machines, just hand tools and dedication.

If you’d like a custom guitar built to your vision, I’d love to discuss it with you. Customers cover the cost of materials they choose, and 25% of any profit is donated to the Teenage Cancer Trust.
